    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
    The first capital of the country was Nara in southern Honshu. It was the capital from 710 to 794 when a new capital
    was built in Heian (known today as Kyoto). The new capital was the seat of the imperial family for the next 1000
    years. The Heian period, as those 1000 years are known today, was a period of great artistic development. Life in
    the capital during those days was marked by great elegance and even greater expense. While the nobility prospered in
    the capital, people in the outlying areas were being impoverished by the heavy taxes demanded to support the
    emperor. In spite of the taxes they were required to pay, the farmers and peasants of that day received little or no
    protection from the imperial government. As time went on, they gravitated toward certain clan leaders who would
    provide protection for them. From this emerged the "Samurai" or warrior social class. Except for taxing authority,
    the power of the imperial government was weak, so in time the samurai seized control of the government and forced
    the emperor to name their leader "Shogun" or generalissimo. The emperor was allowed to continue as the symbol of
    unity of the people, but the power to govern was taken from him and given to the Shogun. m e first shogun
    established his base of operations at Kamakura near present-day Tokyo. At first the court of the shogun bore some
    resemblance to the life lead by the peasants for whom he provided leadership, but gradually the austerity of the
    shogun court was replaced by some of the trappings associated with the imperial court and over time the splendor of
    the shogun's court came to rival that of the emperor 's. During the next four centuries there were a number of
    military challenges to the power of the shoguns.</p>

    <p>
    Tokugawa Ieyasu became shogun in 1600 and his heirs ruled Japan for the next 15 generations.</p>

    <p>
    During the reign of the Tokugawa shoguns, all foreigners were expelled from the land and Japan was closed to trade
    with the rest of the world for 250 years. In 1853, through the efforts of Commodore Matthew Perry, a treaty was
    signed opening Japanese ports to foreign trade.</p>

    <p>
    In 1868, a group of samurai leaders forced the shogun to resign and to return the power of government to the
    emperor, a progressive young man who adopted the title Meiji (meaning "enlightened rule.). Within a single
    generation during the Meiji reign, Japan was transformed from a closed feudal society to one of the world's leading
    powers. A new constitution was written in 1889, bringing Japanese government into the modern era. During Tokugawa
    times, the seat of government was Edo, home district of the original Tokugawa shogun, but the emperor continued to
    reside in Kyoto. In 1869, after the overthrow of the shoguns, the capital was officially moved, along with the
    imperial residence, from Kyoto to Edo and the name of the city was changed from Edo to Tokyo.</p>

    <h3>Population</h3>
    <p>The population of Japan is about 128 million, making it the 10th most populated country in the world today. The area
    of the country is roughly equal to the size of the state of Montana, but about 80% of the land area is too
    mountainous to be developed. The result is that living space is extremely compacted in the 20% of land where the 128
    million people live. The population density in Japan is about 340 per square kilometer making it the ninth most
    densely populated country in the world. That the country can support its population is due in part to the climate, a
    long growing season coupled with very ample rainfall, and a more intensive form of agriculture than is practiced
    elsewhere.</p>

    <h3>Religion</h3>
    <p>
    The majority of Japanese follow two ancient religions, Shinto and Buddhism, which flourish side by side. It is not
    strange to the Japanese to practice different aspects of both at the same time. Many Japanese have small Buddhist
    altars in their homes sitting alongside miniature Shinto shrines. Some Japanese think of Shinto in terms of folkways
    and Buddhism as religion. Shinto, meaning "way of the gods", is native to Japan and dates back to prehistoric times.
    Amaterasu, the sun goddess, is chief "Kami" of the Shintoists. There is no real English translation for kami. Some
    define it as a god, others a divine force. Neither is an absolute definition. Kami is something to be respected
    which provides for all growth and development. Kami is all around in nature. There is no sharp line drawn between
    man and nature and anything in the environment considered awesome may become a kami. Kami are never visible as such,
    but the spirits of the kami are thought to reside at various times in different objects or animals. An object which
    is thought to hold the spirit of a kami is called a "Go-shintai". Common examples of Go-shintai are polished stones,
    swords, mirrors, serpents, wolves, tigers, hares, white wild boars, white deer, crows and foxes. Each follower of
    Shinto worships as he or she pleases. They have no central doctrine or creed except a profound reverence for nature.
    Shinto does not include the concept of an afterlife which is inherent in many other religions.</p>

    <p>
    Buddhism was introduced into Japan in the 6th century AD and rapidly gained converts. In general, Buddhists follow
    concepts of self meditation, simple living and physical discipline which they believe will insure rebirth at a
    higher level after death. Japanese Buddhists find no conflict in embracing Shinto principles along with Buddhism.
    The two religions often share common shrines or objects of worship.</p>

    <p>
    Christianity was introduced in 1549, but has not enjoyed widespread practice among the Japanese, though some
    Christian principles have been taken and used by Japanese who do not consider themselves to be Christians. About 1%
    of Japanese today consider themselves to be Christians.</p>

    <p>
    In general, the ethics practiced by any one Japanese person tend to be a combination of Shinto, Buddhism and
    Christian principles.</p>
